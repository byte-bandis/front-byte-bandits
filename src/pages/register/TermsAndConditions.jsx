      <p>
        Thank you for using Byte-bandits. Right now you are in a very important
        space: our Terms and Conditions of Use which, together with the specific
        conditions (Specific Terms and Conditions of the Byte-bandits Shipping
        Service), the Privacy Policy, the Cookies Policy, the Legal Notice, the
        Community Guidelines and the regulations in force, regulate our
        relationship. We do not expect you to find it fun, but at least
        intelligible, useful, practical and complete. From Byte-bandits we
        strive for our community to understand, within how complex the laws are
        becoming more and more complex, the legal conditions that establish the
        rules of our relationship. These Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms and
        Conditions“) set forth the conditions under which users are offered
        access to Byte-bandits’s websites, services and applications (the
        “Service“). The use of the Service confers the status of user of the
        Service (hereinafter, the “User“) and implies full acceptance of these
        Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with all or part of these
        Terms and Conditions, you must refrain from installing and/or using the
        Service. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you represent: That
        you have read, understand and comprehend what is set forth herein. That
        you assume all the obligations and know your rights as set forth herein
        and those established by the applicable regulations. That you are of
        legal age and have sufficient legal capacity to use the Service. The
        acceptance of these Terms and Conditions by the Users is a prior and
        indispensable step to the use of the Service. Byte-bandits reserves the
        right to update and/or modify the Terms and Conditions at any time and
        for any reason at its sole discretion. Byte-bandits will notify Users of
        any material changes to the Terms and Conditions or the Service. By
        accessing or using the Services after Byte-bandits has notified the User
        of a modification or update, the User agrees to be bound by the modified
        Terms and Conditions. If the modified Terms and Conditions are not
        acceptable to the User, the User shall cease using the Services.
